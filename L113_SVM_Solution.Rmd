# Data Understanding

We will work on heart diseases. On UCI Machine Learning Repository you find "Heart Disease" (dataset)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease].

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to 
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). 


These are the attribute information:

1. age
2. sex
3. cp
4. trestbps
5. chol 
6. fbs
7. restecg
8. thalach
9. exang
10. oldpeak
11. slope
12. ca
13. thal
14. target

## Data Import

```{r}
# if file does not exist, download it first
file_path <- "./data/heart_disease.csv"
if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
  dir.create("./data")
  url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data"
  download.file(url = url, 
                destfile = file_path)
}
```

Import the file to an object called "heart_raw".

```{r}
heart_raw <- read.csv(file_path, header = F)
```

# Data Preparation

## Packages

We load required packages.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(keras))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(caret))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(e1071))

source("./functions/train_val_test.R")
```

## Column Names

Assign the column names correctly. Use these names:

age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak,  slope, ca, thal, target


```{r}
col_names_to_set <- c("age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak",  "slope", "ca", "thal",  "target" 
)

colnames(heart_raw) <- col_names_to_set
```

How many levels of target-variables are present?

```{r}
heart_raw$target %>% unique()
```

Is this a classification or regression task? We will treat it as classification, but I want you to think about it.

```{r}
# Think about the task!
```


## Summary

Check the summary of the data to see if there are missing values. Are there any missing?

```{r}
summary(heart_raw)
```

## Variable Type Correction

Some numerical attributes were wrongly assigned to factors and vice versa. Check the repository description which features were wrongly assigned and correct it.

You would have to check data description. I save you some time.

- to factor:sex, cp, fbs, restecg, exang, slope, thal, target

- to numeric: ca

Don't modify the raw data. Instead create a new object "heart_mod", in which you perform the changes.

```{r}
heart_mod <- heart_raw %>% 
  mutate (sex = as.factor(sex)) %>% 
  mutate (cp = as.factor(cp)) %>% 
  mutate (fbs = as.factor(fbs)) %>% 
  mutate (restecg = as.factor(restecg)) %>% 
  mutate (exang = as.factor(exang)) %>% 
  mutate (slope = as.factor(slope)) %>% 
  mutate (ca = as.numeric(ca)) %>% 
  mutate (thal = as.factor(thal)) %>% 
  mutate (target = as.factor(target))
summary(heart_mod)
```


Filter for values for "?" on "thal"-variable, because no information is available at these positions.

```{r}
heart_mod <- heart_mod %>% 
  filter(thal != "?")
```


## Train / Validation / Test Split

Split the data into train, validation, and test data. Use splitting ratios of 80% training, 20% validation.

```{r}
c(train, val, test) %<-% train_val_test_split(df = heart_mod, train_ratio = 0.8, val_ratio = 0.2)
```


# Modeling 

## Model Creation

Create a Support Vector Machines model for target-variable. Take all other parameters into account.

```{r}
model_svm <- svm(formula = target ~ ., 
                 data = train)
```

# Predictions

Create predictions for train, and validation data. These will be probabilities.

```{r}
train$target_pred <- predict(model_svm, newdata = train)
val$target_pred <- predict(model_svm, newdata = val)
```


# Model Performance

We will compare our classifier to the baseline classifier.

## Baseline Classifier

Please calculate the baseline classifier (assignment to most frequent class). 

Hint: Now you have more than two classes, but the procedure is the same.

```{r}
target_tab <- table(train$target)
max(target_tab)/sum(target_tab)
```

## Confusion Matrix

Calculate a confusion matrix for Training Data:

```{r}
conf_mat_train <- table(predicted = train$target_pred, 
                        actual = train$target)
conf_mat_train
```

Calculate a confusion matrix for Validation Data:

```{r}
conf_mat_val <- table(predicted = val$target_pred, 
                      actual = val$target)
conf_mat_val
```

Calculate the Accuracy from the confusion matrix (for training and validation data).

```{r}
caret::confusionMatrix(conf_mat_train)
caret::confusionMatrix(conf_mat_val)
```

Is our classifier superior to baseline classifier?

```{r}
"No. The accuracy level is similar to the baseline classifier, so there is no improvement "
```

# Hyperparameter Tuning

Create models for a range of cost-parameters.

Hint: Inspect tune.svm() function from **e1071** package. Provide a range for parameters cost and gamma. Find the best parameter set and create a new model with these parameters.

Hint: You modified training and validation dataset. Think whether you can take all variables into account or if you need to drop some.

Calculate confusion matrices and get accuracies.

```{r}
train$target_pred <- NULL
cost_range <- 10^(-3:2)
gamma_range <- 10^(-5:-1)
model_svm_tuning <- tune.svm(target ~ ., 
                             data = train, 
                             cost = cost_range,
                             gamma = gamma_range)

summary_mod <- summary(model_svm_tuning)
summary_mod$best.parameters

model_svm_best <- svm(target ~ ., 
                             data = train, 
                             cost = 100,
                             gamma = 0.01)

train$target_pred <- predict(model_svm_best, newdata = train)
val$target_pred <- predict(model_svm_best, newdata = val)

conf_mat_train <- table(predicted = train$target_pred, 
                        actual = train$target)
conf_mat_train

conf_mat_val <- table(predicted = val$target_pred, 
                      actual = val$target)
conf_mat_val

caret::confusionMatrix(conf_mat_train)
caret::confusionMatrix(conf_mat_val)
```
