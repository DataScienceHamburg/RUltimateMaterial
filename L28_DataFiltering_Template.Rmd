# Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Data Preparation

## Load Data

```{r}
# code here
```

```{r}
# code here
```

## Filtering Rows

You can filter for rows with **filter()**.

You can use all comparison operators, e.g. ==, !=, <=, >=, ...

You also can check for categories with %in%.

```{r}
# code here
```

Other row-based filters are **sample_n()**

```{r}
# code here
```

or **slice()**.

```{r}
# code here
```

or **top_n()**.

## Filtering Columns

You can filter for columns with **select()**.

There are two ways to approach this:

1. White-List: define the columns that you want to keep

2. Black-List: define the columns that you don't want to keep

```{r}
# code here
```
