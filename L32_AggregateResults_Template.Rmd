# Data Preparation

```{r}
data("population")
population
```

We use the dataset "population", which shows the population for `r unique(population$country) %>% length()` countries and the period from `r min(population$year)` to `r max(population$year)`.

Data is stored in a tidy format. It looks like this.

```{r}
population %>% head()
```

# Data Aggregation

We want to calculate the min, max, and increase of population for each country.

At first the data is grouped for the category that should be used for grouping. Then in the summarise()
function the logic is described, which defines new columns to be created and how these should be calculated.
 
```{r}
# code here
```
