# Introduction

We create two ranges that overlap.

```{r}
a <- 1 : 10
b <- 5 : 15
```

# Intersect

*intersect()* calculates the intersection of two vectors.

```{r}

intersect(a, b)
```

# Setdiff

*setdiff()* calculates the difference of two vectors.

```{r}
setdiff(a, b)
```

# Union

*union()* calculates all unique observations from both vectors.

```{r}
union(a, b)
```
