# Data Preparation

# Exercise

- Load the dataset "txhousing", which holds information on Texas housing market.

```{r}
# code here
```

- Calculate the average sales for each city. During the calculation of mean values the result is coerced to NA, if there is a single NA present. Disable this functionality and change it so that missing values are excluded.

```{r}
# code here
```

- Calculate the average sales for city and year and save it in object "tx_city_year".

```{r}
# code here
```

Plot the data with ggplot:

```{r}
# ggplot(tx_city_year, aes(x = year, y = mean_sales, col = city)) + 
#   geom_line() + 
#   labs(x = "Year", y = "Mean Sales", title = "Average Sales per Year and City")
```
