# Business Understanding

You will create an image classifier for monkey species. You find more information [here](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species).

# Data Understanding

The dataset consists of two files, training and validation. Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form Wikipedia's monkey cladogram. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images). Images were downloaded with help of the googliser open source code.

The data has these attributes:

- n0, alouatta_palliata

- n1, erythrocebus_patas

- n2, cacajao_calvus 

- n3, macaca_fuscata   

- n4, cebuella_pygmea

- n5, cebus_capucinus

- n6, mico_argentatus

- n7, saimiri_sciureus 

- n8, aotus_nigriceps

- n9, trachypithecus_johnii

# Data Preparation

## Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(keras)
```

## Load Data

Data was prepared in section on multi-label classification. If you want to know more about which steps were taken, go to this section.

```{r}
n_max <- 150
load("./data_processed/TrainData.RDA")
load("./data_processed/ValidData.RDA")
train_labels_factors <- train_labels %>%
  as.factor() %>% 
  as.numeric()-1
```

We need to rearrange our training and validation data to make it work with CNN.

```{r}
# code here
```


# Model

## Layer Setup and Model Configuration

```{r}
create_cnn_model <- function() {
# code here

}
```

## Model Training

```{r}
# dnn_cnn_model <- create_cnn_model()
# history <- dnn_cnn_model %>% 
#   fit(train_images_4D, train_labels_factors, 
#       validation_split = 0.2,
#       batch_size = 256,
#       epochs = 10)
# plot(history,
#      smooth = F)

```

We save the model, so that we don't have to run it again.

```{r}
filepath <- "./models/dnn_cnn.h5"
# save_model_hdf5(object = dnn_cnn_model, filepath = filepath)
# dnn_cnn_model %>% summary()

# code here


```

# Model Evaluation

We will create predictions and create plots to show correlation of prediction and actual values.

## Make Predictions

First, we create predictions, that we then can compare to actual values.

```{r}
# prepare resulting dataframe with predicted and actual labels
valid_check <- tibble(label_pred = NA,
                      label_act = valid_labels %>% 
  gsub(pattern = "n", replacement = ""))
n_valid <- dim(valid_images_4D)[1]
for (id_curr in 1:n_valid) {
  valid_image <- array(valid_images_4D[id_curr,,, ], dim = c(1, n_max, n_max, 1))
  # dim(valid_image)  # check dimensions of image
  predictions <- dnn_cnn_model %>% 
    predict(valid_image)
  label_pred <-which.max(predictions)-1
  valid_check$label_pred[id_curr] <- label_pred
 # print(id_curr)
}
```

## Baseline Classifier

```{r}
tab_act <- table(valid_check$label_act)
max(tab_act) / sum(tab_act) * 100
```

If we assign all "predictions" to the most frequent class, we get an accuracy of 11 %. This is what our algorithm should exceed to be useful.

## Confusion Matrix

```{r}
table(valid_check$label_pred, valid_check$label_act)
```

We use function **confusionMatrix()** from caret package and pass actual and predicted labels.

```{r}
caret::confusionMatrix(as.factor(valid_check$label_pred),
                       as.factor(valid_check$label_act))
```

Cohen's kappa is reasonable, which indicates that our model provides better results than pure chance (Baseline classifier). 

Our accuracy is 0.33, which means our model accuracy is three-times the accuracy of pure chance.

To improve model performance you could basically run it longer (increase epochs to e.g. 100 or 200).
